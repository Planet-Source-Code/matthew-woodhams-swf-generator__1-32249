                  SWF GENERATOR!                   
                                        
Before you start!
 In order for the project to work you must first
download bukoo (only 86kb and Free!) 
http://bukoo.sourceforge.net/swfobjs_2.zip
then register swfobjs.dll to your system.  
You can do this by simply draging the 'swfobjs.dll' 
file over the 'regsvr32.exe' file. After this run
the project and everything should work perfectly.

           
  Hello all, the SWF Generator project is a little 
demo I made to check the power of Bukoo, a COM    
object that allows you to create to create Flash  
movies. It is still in Beta testing but is very   
powerful all the same.                            
Most of it is commented but if you need any help  
contact me.                                       
BUGS!: I've only worked with it for a few days and
have not yet been able to completly understand the
'MakePicture' function. So adding pictures is not 
working correctly.                                
Another bug is the sizes, the vb size and the     
Bukoo sizes are not the same...          

Note: this demo is still not finished I have only 
worked 2 days on it, but I though it would be good
to show you it.          
    
Thanks a lot, hope this helps. please vote!
